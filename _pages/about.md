Hello! I am a first-year PhD student in Economics at the Pennsylvania State University. Prior to the PhD career, I obtained a Master degree in Economics at Duke University and a Bachelor degree in Political Science in Peking University, China.

My major academic interests include game theory, information economics and political economics. Specifically, my research agenda focuses on (i) principal-agent relations and models; (ii) the effect of transparency in various strategic interactions; (iii) how information plays its role in political arena. In addition, I have some long-standing interest in auctions, cheap talks, accountability in non-democracies, etc.
